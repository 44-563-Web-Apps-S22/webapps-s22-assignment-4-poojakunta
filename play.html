    <b> SCENE I</b><br><br>
    Madame Pernelle and her servant--<span class="desc"> Flipote, Elmire, Mariane, Dorine, Damis, Cleante</span><br>

    <h6 class ="name PERNELLE">PERNELLE<h6> 
        Let's go, Flipote, let's go. I hate this place.
    <h6>ELMIRE </h6>
    I can't keep up, you rush at such a pace.


    <h6 class ="name PERNELLE">PERNELLE</h6>
    <span class="direction">[He begins to leave.]</span>
    <P>Peace, my dear, peace; come no farther.
    I don't wish to cause you any bother.</P>

    <h6 class ="name ELMIRE">ELMIRE</h6> 
    <P>What duty demands, I insist on giving.
    But, mother, what has caused your hasty leaving?</P>

    <h6 class ="name CLITANDRE">ELMIRE</h6> 
    <P>What duty demands, I insist on giving.
    But, mother, what has caused your hasty leaving?</P>

    <h6 class ="name PERNELLE">PERNELLE</h6>
    <P> I just can't stand the way your household runs . . .
    And no one cares what I wish to have done.
    Oh, yes, I leave your household quite dissatisfied
    For all my wise advice has been defied . . .
    And nobody respects me, and everybody shouts,
    And truly this is a home for the king of louts!
    Dorine. If . . .</P>

    <h6 class ="name PERNELLE">PERNELLE</h6> 
    <P>You, my dearie, are a bold lassy,
    A little brazen and very sassy,
    You butt into everything to speak your mind.
    Damis.</P>
